This program is a "learning c++" project for me.
I am more than happy to share the source with anyone who may find it usefull for their own projects.

This program utilizes unix sockets to send messages over a LAN.
It uses multithreading to overcome waiting on the read function before being able to send a message.

This program was created with Qt Creator.
